# Learn words React App

In this prodject I use:
- React;
- Redux
- Type script;
- React-router;
- Bulma from style;
- Multiple classnames with CSS Modules in React;
- LocalStorage;

   In this app we have four pages. 

   After first start you have empty vocabulary, 
   but when you added words, they save in localStorage.

   First page:
    - Vocabulary;
   Second page:
    - form to add new words;
   Third page:
    - Training words from vocabulary if we have more then 10 word in vocabulary;
   Fourth page:
    - Traning statistic
